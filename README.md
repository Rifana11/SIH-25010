## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description

Small and marginal farmers often face financial instability due to low crop prices immediately after harvest. Many farmers are forced to sell their produce quickly to meet urgent cash needs, which prevents them from earning optimal profit. Lack of proper storage facilities results in post-harvest losses and spoilage of crops. In addition, limited access to real-time market information leaves farmers dependent on middlemen, who often exploit them by offering low prices. Poor storage and hurried sales discourage farmers from investing in better seeds or inputs for future crops. This creates a cycle of low income and high vulnerability to crop failure. Addressing these issues is essential to improve both income stability and farming sustainability.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

The immediate sale of crops at harvest significantly reduces farmer income and financial stability. Farmers are unable to invest in quality seeds, fertilizers, and labor for the next season. Post-harvest losses due to inadequate storage further reduce the effective yield. Dependence on middlemen also reduces their bargaining power, leaving them with minimal profit. Low income increases the risk of debt cycles and makes them more vulnerable to market fluctuations. The lack of incentives discourages adoption of improved agricultural techniques. Overall, this impacts not only individual farmers but also the broader rural economy and food security.

Expected Outcomes

By implementing a proper advisory system, farmers will earn higher profits from their produce. Safe storage and informed selling decisions reduce post-harvest losses and wastage. Farmers gain access to timely market information, helping them sell at optimal prices. The additional income allows them to invest in quality seeds, fertilizers, and farm equipment for the next season. Collective marketing strengthens their bargaining power and reduces dependency on middlemen. Farmers become more financially stable and motivated to adopt better farming practices. This leads to a more resilient and productive agricultural community.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

The primary beneficiaries of this system are small and marginal farmers who struggle with post-harvest losses and low income. Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and cooperatives gain advantages by collectively storing and selling produce. Local markets and retailers benefit from a more stable supply chain. Agricultural extension officers and government agencies play a role in providing training and monitoring. NGOs working in rural development can support technology adoption. Consumers indirectly benefit from better-managed supply chains and reduced wastage. Overall, the system strengthens the agricultural ecosystem at multiple levels.

Supporting Data

Research shows that post-harvest losses in India range from 20‚Äì30% for cereals, pulses, and perishable crops. Market price data indicates fluctuations of 15‚Äì25% between harvest and later sale periods. Case studies from successful FPOs reveal a 10‚Äì20% increase in profits when farmers sell collectively. Surveys highlight that most small farmers lack access to storage facilities and market price information. Mobile penetration in rural areas is above 70%, making technology-based advisories feasible. Government agricultural reports emphasize the need for improved post-harvest management. Collectively, this data supports the importance and feasibility of a crop advisory system for small farmers.

## Problem Creater's Organization

The issues arise mainly due to middlemen controlling crop pricing and market access. Inadequate government or private storage infrastructure exacerbates post-harvest losses. Limited availability of real-time market information keeps farmers dependent on intermediaries. Weak farmer cooperatives reduce bargaining power and collective action. Lack of awareness about safe storage and post-harvest management contributes to financial losses. Low investment in rural technology limits timely access to price alerts and advisory services. Together, these factors create an environment where small farmers cannot maximize their earnings or secure long-term sustainability.

## Theme

"Enhancing Farmer Income Through Smart Storage and Market-Driven Selling.‚Äù 

## Proposed Solution

<h3>‚ÄúThe proposed solution is to help farmers store harvested crops safely, monitor market demand, and sell at the right time to gain better profits for reinvestment.‚Äù</h3>
<ul><li>The proposed solution is a comprehensive small crop advisory system that helps farmers maximize income and reduce losses. It focuses on safe storage of harvested produce using low-cost and effective methods such as metal bins, tarpaulin-covered godowns, or natural preservation techniques like neem leaves or ash. </li>
<li> The system includes market demand monitoring through mobile apps, SMS alerts, and local market boards to guide farmers on the best time to sell.</li></ul>

## Technical Approach
<h3>The technical approach combines low-cost storage solutions, mobile-based market monitoring, and cooperative selling strategies. Farmers are trained to use simple storage techniques such as metal bins, tarpaulin-covered godowns, and natural preservation methods to prevent post-harvest losses.</h3>
<ul><li>‚ÄúThe programming language to be used is Python, as it is easy to learn, supports data processing, and can be integrated with mobile or web platforms to deliver advisory services to farmers.‚Äù üåæ</li>

## Feasibility and Viability
<h3>The system is highly feasible due to the widespread availability of mobile phones and rural connectivity. Low-cost storage methods make adoption affordable for small and marginal farmers. Training programs can be conducted through government extension services, NGOs, or local cooperatives.</h3>
<ul><li> Training programs can be conducted through government extension services, NGOs, or local cooperatives. Collective selling reduces individual risk and improves market leverage. The system can be scaled to different regions and crops without major investment. Its benefits are sustainable, as farmers can continuously use the model for successive harvests.</li>
